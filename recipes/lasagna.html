    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Lasagna is the perfect meal, and of all of the recipes Ive tried over the years, this is the perfect lasagna.<br>We loved it so much, we even turned it into Lasagna Roll Ups and Zucchini Lasagna (which is gluten-free).<br>Its flavorful and satisfying but also easy to make.</p>

    <p>This 3-cheese lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, and the ingredients are refrigerator and pantry staples.<br>See the recipe card below for exact quantities.</p>




        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><Strong>Ground Beef</Strong> - We used 80/20 beef (20% fat content) for a juicier lasagna but a lean ground beef is perfectly acceptable.<br>You can also sub half of the beef with Italian sausage for variety.</li> 
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Onion</Strong> - It is recommended to use Yellow Onion, however a Sweet Onion works as well!</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Garlic cloves</Strong> - You can add more if you love a garlicky taste!</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Red Wine</Strong> - This amps the flavor up of your sauce (<strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not use cooking wine) </li>
            You can sub the wine for beef broth or stock.
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Marinara Sauce</Strong> - Use Homemade marinara or store bought.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Dried thyme</Strong> - Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Sugar</Strong> - balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Parsley</Strong> - Flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Lasagna Noodles</Strong> - Cook these al dente; they'll continue to soften as the lasgana bakes.<br><em>Note:</em> You can also use no-boil noodles.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Cottage Cheese</Strong> - adds great texture and moisture.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Ricotta Cheese</Strong> - Recommended to use low-fat or part-skin ricotta</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Mozzarella Cheese</Strong> - An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is the most classic choice.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li><Strong>Egg</Strong> - Helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Pro Tip for Lasagna Noodles:</strong></h3>
        <p>Use a very large pot of salted water to boil the lasagna noodles and stir them several times,<br>especially right after adding them to the pot. This will keep them from sticking to each other and tearing.</p>

    <h2><strong>Which is better for lasagna, Cottage cheese or ricotta?</strong></h2>

        <p>Cottage cheese is healthier, and ricotta is creamier, so you can use both to get both benefits of the two cheeses in your lasagna.</p>

    <h2>What is <em>"al dente"</em>?</h2>
        
        <p> Cooking al dente pasta means it should be <em>"firm to the bite"</em>. The package instructions will provide the cook time for pasta to reach al dente. Keep in mind, the lasagna will be baked for 45 minutes so it's better if your noodles are undercooked.</p>

    <h2>What is the best marinara sauce for lasagna?</h2>
        
        <p>Homemade marinara is definitely best, but if you don't have time to make it, use your favorite store bought marinara sauce. A high quality sauce like Rao's is a good bet.</p>

    <h2>Can i double the lasagna recipe?</h2>
        
        <p>Yes, you can easily double this recipe, but you'll need to bake the lasagna in two pans unless you have a large casserole dish.</p>
